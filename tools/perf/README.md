# `tools/perf` — the frame-time harness

One command, from a clean checkout:

```sh
npm run perf:setup   # once per machine — downloads Playwright's Chromium
npm run perf
```

`perf:setup` is a separate step on purpose. Playwright is a devDependency
with no `postinstall`, because this repo builds a Fly image and an
unconditional ~150 MB Chromium download would land in every deploy. If you
skip it the harness stops before measuring anything and names this command.

It builds the client, boots the real server on a free port, joins headless in
GPU-backed Chromium, flies a fixed path, and prints **p50 / p95 / p99 / worst
frame and draw calls per segment** — plus a JSON report at
`tools/perf/last.json`.

Nothing here is player-facing. The client changes it depends on are a few
read-only `window.__ab` hooks and three URL query knobs; the game's default
configuration is exactly what a plain visit gets.

## Read this before you read a number

**Mean fps is never reported, on purpose.** A 2 % frame at 200 ms averages
away and is precisely the stutter players call lag. Every headline here is
p50, p95, p99 and the single worst frame.

**The reported row is one real pass, never a mix of columns.** With `--runs N`
each segment reports the MEDIAN pass, chosen by its **GPU p50** — the column
every claim rests on — and the whole row comes from that one pass. Assembling
a row column-by-column would let it publish a `gpuP95` below its own `gpuP50`,
or a `worst` beside draw calls from a different pass, and an impossible row is
worse than a noisy one. **Prefer an odd `--runs`**: with an even count "the
median" is a choice between two passes rather than a reading.

**A skipped GPU frame is shouted about, not swallowed.** The timer holds a
pool of queries and the pool empties exactly when the GPU is behind — i.e. on
the expensive frames p95/p99/worst are made of. If any frame went unmeasured
the report says so and those columns must not be quoted.

**Vsync is disabled** (`--disable-gpu-vsync --disable-frame-rate-limit`).
With vsync on, an M3 renders this scene in ~10 ms and *reports* 16.7 ms,
because 16.7 ms is when the next frame is allowed to start — every
optimisation would measure as exactly zero. So the numbers below are **frame
costs, not the frame rate a player sees**. A p50 of 8 ms means "60 fps with
2× headroom"; a p50 of 20 ms means the player is already dropping frames.

**The pixel ratio is pinned** (default `2` — a Retina panel). The adaptive
scaler would otherwise change the workload mid-measurement and silently turn
every comparison into a comparison of two different resolutions. Measure the
scaler with `--res auto`; measure anything *else* with it pinned.

**The GPU is real.** `--use-angle=metal --enable-gpu` puts Chromium on Apple
Metal. Without those flags it falls back to SwiftShader, which collapses to
~9 fps under the bloom chain and tells you nothing about a real machine.

**The first pass is thrown away.** Every arm flies one complete, identical,
discarded pass before anything is counted. Two things make an un-warmed first
pass a liar, and the second needs a pass this long: ANGLE/Metal cache
translated shaders and compiled pipeline states at the *browser* level (a
short lap fixes that), and the GPU's own clock ramps under sustained load (a
short lap does not). With the caches warm, a 3-pass run still read pass 1 high
on every segment and then settled — core `10.24 → 7.49 → 7.64`, plaza `8.63 →
6.83 → 6.68` — uniform, monotone, draw calls identical. Discarding pass 1 took
the worst spread from **2.76 ms (36.8 %) to 0.38 ms (5.1 %)**.

**The GPU columns are contention-*resistant*, not contention-proof.** They are
far steadier than wall clock, but a saturated machine does move them. Every
report prints and stores its `loadavg`; check it before trusting a small
delta. Numbers recorded here at load ~3 are repeatable to ~5 %, and the same
build at load ~220 is not repeatable at all.

**There is a measurement floor at roughly 4 ms of GPU time.** Below it the
timer query is measuring its own overhead and the queue depth as much as the
scene: pinned to `--res 1` the scene costs ~2–4 ms and three passes read core
`1.98 → 3.90 → 3.12` with draw calls identical every time. Absolute numbers
from a cheap configuration are indicative only. A paired `--ab` delta still
survives — both arms sit in the same state — but quote the conservative end.

## Why a fixed path measures anything at all

This game is unusually benchmarkable, and it is not luck — it falls out of
contracts the project already holds:

- the city is generated from a seeded PRNG with **no `Math.random` anywhere**,
  and the server hands every client the same `CITY_SEED`;
- the storm schedule is a **pure function of (seed, time)**;
- street traffic is a **pure function of the synced server clock**.

Same seed plus the same viewpoint therefore means the same scene, down to the
instance counts. The harness exploits that and pins both: the seed comes from
the server (unchanged), the viewpoint from `segments.mjs`, and it sets the
room's bot count to **0** before measuring — bots are a live sim whose poses
depend on wall-clock timing and would smear every segment.

### The path

| segment  | what it stresses                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core`   | dense midtown at facade height — signage, lamps, traffic, windows   |
| `plaza`  | the open plaza block — sparse geometry, wide ground plane           |
| `sky`    | high and level — the whole skyline inside `FOG_DISTANCE` at once    |
| `canyon` | low down the `x = 200` street — closest geometry, most overdraw     |
| `storm`  | a scheduled strike inside the window — bolt, flash, fog, reveals    |

Every segment is crash-proof by construction (`segments.mjs` documents the
two rules), and the harness **shouts if the plane died during one** — a dead
plane renders a kill-cam, not the scene you meant to measure.

### Determinism, and its one honest exception

`--runs N` flies the whole path N times in fresh pages and reports the
agreement:

```
determinism over 2 passes: worst p50 spread 3.4%, draw calls identical per segment
```

**Stated tolerance — declared in `run.mjs` as `TOLERANCE`, checked by the
harness itself, and printed as PASS/FAIL:**

| number         | tolerance                             | why                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| draw calls     | **identical** per segment              | Scene identity — an integer count of what was submitted, so it cannot drift for timing reasons. If it moves, the harness stopped pinning the scene and nothing measured against it is trustworthy. |
| GPU p50        | **within 10 % or 1.0 ms**, whichever is looser, **per segment** | The render cost. Every optimisation claim in a PR rests on this number. The two halves are checked segment by segment: taking the worst percentage and the worst millisecond figure across all segments and then OR-ing them could FAIL a run in which every single segment passed. |
| wall-clock p50 | reported, **not asserted**             | It includes the sim, the socket, JS GC and whatever else the machine is running. |

The "or 1.0 ms" half is the load-bearing part, and it is not a fudge factor —
it is the shape a timing tolerance has to have. A pure percentage band gets
*stricter the faster the scene renders*: the same 0.9 ms of run-to-run drift
is 5 % of an 18 ms `legacy` frame and 12 % of the 7.4 ms frame that replaced
it, so shipping win A would have "broken" determinism by making the game
faster. What this harness can honestly claim is a **resolution** — it tells
two configurations apart when they differ by more than about a millisecond.
For scale, win A measured **5.0 ms**; the band it has to clear is 1.0.

Wall-clock p50 is left out of the verdict on purpose, not to make the check
easier to pass. Measured here on a box at **load average ~100** (parallel
agent worktrees), one pass ran a uniform ~30 % slower in wall clock across
*every* segment while its GPU cost and draw calls held — the unmistakable
signature of the machine rather than the build. Asserting that would make the
harness fail for reasons unrelated to the code under test, and a check that
fails for unrelated reasons gets disabled and then ignored. **Read the GPU
columns for render changes.**

`--strict` turns a FAIL into exit code 1; without it the harness reports and
returns 0 (see "Should this gate CI?" below).

**Two segments are honest exceptions, and both for the same reason** — the
harness pins the seed and the path, but it cannot pin the *server clock*
without a server change:

- `storm` — strike *positions* are a function of absolute time, so which cell
  gets hit varies between runs. The viewpoint is fixed and the flash/fog/
  reveal work is global, so the cost is stable, but its draw calls are
  excluded from the "identical" check.
- `canyon` — the most expensive viewpoint on the path and the least
  repeatable. At `y=45` the camera is at street level, where instanced
  traffic and its headlights fill more of the frame than anywhere else, and
  traffic pose is a pure function of the synced server clock. The signature
  shows up in every multi-pass run: canyon's GPU p50 swings (`10.2 → 14.0 →
  9.9 ms`) while its **wall** p50 falls monotonically (`7.6 → 7.4 → 7.2`) and
  its draw calls stay pinned at 107. Contention would push wall and GPU up
  together; more GPU work at constant draw calls is a fuller frame, not a
  busier machine. Read canyon's paired `--ab` delta, not its absolute number.

Everything else is pinned.

## Flags

| flag                 | default            | meaning                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--label <name>`     | `run`              | recorded in the report; shows in the table      |
| `--aa <mode>`        | client default     | `legacy` \| `msaa` \| `smaa`                    |
| `--res <r\|auto>`    | `2`                | pin the pixel ratio, or hand it to the scaler   |
| `--runs <n>`         | `1`                | passes; the reported segment is the **median pass**, ranked by GPU p50. Prefer an odd number |
| `--out <file>`       | `tools/perf/last.json` | where the JSON report goes                 |
| `--baseline`         | off                | also overwrite `tools/perf/baseline.json`       |
| `--ab "<query>"`     | —                  | second arm, **interleaved** with the first      |
| `--compare <file>`   | —                  | print a delta table against an earlier report   |
| `--no-build`         | off                | reuse the existing `client/dist`                |
| `--port <n>`         | a free port        | server port                                     |
| `--headed`           | off                | watch it fly                                    |
| `--strict`           | off                | exit 1 if the determinism check FAILs (needs `--runs` >= 2) |

**`--ab` is how you measure a render change you actually trust.** It runs a
second arm with the given query-string overrides and **interleaves** the
passes (A, B, A, B) instead of running all of A then all of B. The GPU's
clock state drifts over a run — a straight A-then-B comparison once showed
pass 2 reading ~40 % different on *identical* work — so alternating puts that
drift into both arms equally and makes the delta paired. Prefer `--ab` over
`--compare` whenever both arms can be produced from the same build:

```sh
npm run perf -- --runs 3 --label "aa=off (ships)" --ab "aa=legacy"
```

`--aa legacy` reproduces the pre-P1 wiring — `WebGLRenderer({antialias:
true})` and a plain composer target — out of the *current* build, so a
before/after can be measured without checking out an old commit.

### Recipes

```sh
# Record a fresh baseline (three passes, median reported)
npm run perf -- --runs 3 --label baseline --baseline

# Did my change cost anything?
npm run perf -- --label my-change --compare tools/perf/baseline.json

# Which antialiasing mode is cheaper on this machine? (paired — preferred)
npm run perf -- --runs 3 --label "aa=off" --ab "aa=legacy"

# How much does the scaler recover when it backs off a step?
npm run perf -- --runs 3 --res 1.5 --label "res=1.5" --ab "res=2"

# Watch the adaptive scaler instead of pinning the ratio
npm run perf -- --res auto --label scaler
```

## The client hooks it uses

All read-only except the two that exist for QA, all on `window.__ab`:

| hook                             | used for                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `teleport(x, z, y, yaw)`         | the scripted path                           |
| `perfReset()` / `perfStats()`    | one segment's frame-time window             |
| `perfSamples()`                  | raw per-frame times, for histograms         |
| `render()`                       | AA mode, pixel ratio, drawing-buffer size   |
| `setPixelRatio(r \| "auto")`     | pin or release the scaler at runtime        |
| `setBots(0)`                     | empty the room so the scene is reproducible |
| `storm()` / `net()` / `combat()` | strike timing, clock, alive check           |

The same `FrameMeter` (`client/src/render/perfmeter.ts`) feeds `perfStats()`,
the in-game dev HUD and the adaptive resolution controller, so the number in
this report and the number on screen can never disagree.

## The dev HUD

Press **`P`** in a dev build (or visit any build with `?perf=1`) for a live
overlay of fps, p50/p95/p99, worst frame, draw calls and the current pixel
ratio. It is off by default and hidden behind `body.perf`, the same toggle
idiom free-look and fullscreen use. It exists because a benchmark cannot
catch *felt* hitching — percentiles plus a live overlay covers both halves.

## Should this gate CI?

Not yet — **report now, gate later**. The baseline needs a few PRs of trust
first, and a flaky gate gets disabled and then ignored. `--compare` gives a
reviewer the delta table today, which is the part that actually changes
behaviour.
